# Out-of-the-Box Sample
This document provides information about how to use this sample integration.

## About this sample
This sample shows the simplest way to create a new configurator app, by using all the out-of-the-box behavior implemented by FE-Commons.

## What youâ€™ll build
You'll build an integration sample where you can create instances that notifies you whenever a webhook is triggered.

## Requirements
In order to run the configurator sample you'll need [Node 6.10.x][node] and [npm][npm] installed.

## Instructions for Javascript Developers 
1. Clone or download the App-Integrations-FE-Commons repository
2. In the out-of-the-box sample folder run `npm install`
3. After installing the dependencies run `npm run watch`

The samples folder is set up with multiple development samples built up with [webpack][webpack] and [eslint][eslint]. Every time you change a file and save it, eslint checks your code sintaxe and webpack reloads your browser. This sample is buit up with React and some imported components from this repo.

### Running the sample locally from bundle.json
This sample is deliverid with a *bundle.json* file. This file allows you to run the app directly from your symphony pod. In order to run the app with the bundle.json file you should follow these steps:
1. Add the alias `127.0.0.1 localhost` to your `/etc/hosts` file.
2. Change directory to the `samples/out-of-the-box-configurator` folder
3. Install packages with `npm install`
4. Run the app with `npm run watch` command
5. Visit `https://localhost:4000/bundle.json` in your browser and accept the certificate.
6. Visit your symphony pod, and, in the address bar, paste the following at the end of the url:  `?bundle=https://localhost:4000/bundle.json`. 
7. Reload the page and you'll see an modal window asking you to allow the appliction to run. Check the _I have verified the app configurations_ checkbox. 
8. Find your application in the _Symphony market_ on your pod, click _Add_, and then, _Configure_.
